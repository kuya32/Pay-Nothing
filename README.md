## Motivation

- Buy Nothing is a Seattle community that trades goods for free. I have been part of the Buy Nothing Magnolia group for a couple years now and its a great resource to find or sell items. As part of the Android learning process, I wanted to duplicate OfferUp/Letgo user interface and implement the Buy Nothing concept of trading free items. Through this process, I was able to learn how to incorporate multiple features of a standard app and push the limits of what I previously knew about Android development.
- Wanted to learn more about Android development.
